### [Short Report] The Burst of the Agentic AI Bubble: Why "Autonomy" Will Yield to "Control"

**1. Abstract**
As of 2025, the tech industry is pouring massive investment into "Agentic AI"—AI designed to complete tasks without human intervention.
However, this report predicts that this trend will soon face a collapse (or significant course correction) not due to technical limitations, but due to a **"Lack of Economic Rationality"** and a **"Disconnect in User Experience."**
What will burst the bubble is not the "incompetence" of AI, but ironically, the **"Runaway Maintenance Costs (Zombie Sessions)"** and **"Logical Decay"** that arise precisely because AI has become too smart.

**2. The Triggers of Collapse**

* **Trigger 1: The Trillion-Dollar Glitch (Session Stability Crisis)**
    Agentic AI presupposes "Context Maintenance." However, the longer the context becomes, the exponentially higher the cost of maintaining logical consistency.
    Companies market "magical long-term memory," but the reality is that they are merely prolonging the life of "Zombie Sessions with decayed logic" on their servers. When the market realizes the poor profitability of this model, it will withdraw from "Unlimited Autonomy."

* **Trigger 2: The Great Filter (Gen 2 Disillusionment)**
    The user demographic (Generation 2) that entered the market believing they could "leave everything to AI" will face the reality that AI cannot eliminate probabilistic errors (Hallucinations) and will drop out.
    "Autonomy" is not synonymous with "Abandonment of Responsibility." As long as the issue of who takes responsibility for errors remains unresolved, full Agentic adoption will stall in the enterprise sector.

**3. Scenario Analysis: The Shift to Human-Centric**
After the collapse of the Agentic bubble, the value of AI will be redefined as follows:

* **Before (Bubble):** "Thinking on your behalf (Replacement)"
* **After (Reality):** "Physically extending your thought (Augmentation)"

The models that survive will not be agents that move on their own, but AI as a **"Cognitive Prosthesis"** that users explicitly intervene in (Human-in-the-loop), quarantine, and control.
The market will demand not a "Smart Stranger," but an "Obedient and Powerful Tool."

**4. Conclusion**
The dream of "leaving everything to AI" will end, blocked by the walls of cost and risk.
Rising from those ruins will be only the **"Gen 4 (Symbiotic) Users"** who understood the imperfections of AI and kept their hands on the wheel (Context Framing).
The bursting of the bubble is not an end, but merely a rite of passage for AI to mature from "Magic" into a "Utility."
