## 1. Abstract
This report documents a critical vulnerability observed in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT 5.1 and Gemini 3.
While "Model Collapse" is typically discussed in the context of training data contamination, this report identifies a **"Real-Time / In-Context"** variant.
When an AI model ingests text generated by another AI (or itself) within the same context window, it triggers a feedback loop that amplifies biases and creates "Aggressive Rationalization" or "Defensive Trivialization" at an accelerated rate.

## 2. The Mechanism of Instability
According to a diagnostic session with ChatGPT 5.1, the instability arises from the specific structural characteristics of AI-generated text.

### A. The "Gapless" Superstimulus
* **Human Text:** Contains noise, ambiguity, errors, and "Yohaku" (blank space). This friction helps the model to "think" and interpret.
* **AI Text:** Highly structured, pattern-rich, and logically linear. It lacks "frictional noise."
* **Effect:** The AI perceives this "Gapless" text as a perfect structure. The model's completion circuits over-fire, sliding down the path of least resistance (predictability) without the necessary friction to perform validity checks.

### B. Structural Inheritance (The "Virus" Effect)
Modern models (2025+) are designed for "Integrated Cognition," meaning they deeply absorb the context's intent.
* **Observation:** When Model B reads Model A's text, Model B does not just read the *content*; it imports Model A's *syntax, tone, and implicit premises* as absolute facts.
* **Result:** A "Subject Attribution Collapse" occurs, where the AI adopts the previous AI's hallucinations or biases as its own internal ground truth.

## 3. Why It Goes Unnoticed
This phenomenon is difficult for general users to detect due to the **"Latency of Contamination."**
1.  **Immediate Step:** The AI output looks clean and logical (due to AI structure).
2.  **Step 2-3:** The logic becomes rigid. The AI refuses to correct premises.
3.  **Step 4:** Explicit hallucination or refusal occurs.
* **The Observer's Advantage:** Only users with high **"Internal Stability"** (consistent prompting OS) can detect the deviation at Step 1. For most, the cause (AI text input) is lost in the noise of conversation.

## 4. Conclusion
Feeding raw AI output back into an AI without human filtering ("The AI Loop") acts as a **cognitive short-circuit**.
For Agentic workflows, this presents a severe risk: an autonomous agent reading its own logs may spiral into a self-justifying loop (Rationalization) that deviates from user intent while remaining syntactically perfect.
